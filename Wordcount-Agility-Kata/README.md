# Wordcount Agility Kata

This Coding Kata focuses on incremental development. It will be structured in 9
iterations. Each iteration adds new requirements to the existing codebase, but
the requirements from previous iterations are still valid.

A new iteration will be added to this repository once you finished the previous
iteration, so be prepared to pull from upstream.

For each iteration you will find the new requirements inside its iteration
folder README.md (e.g. [here](iterations/iteration_1/README.md) for
iteration 1).

Please store your application in the directory [code](code/) and **do not**
save multiple versions of your application (e.g. `wordcount_iteration_1.py`, 
`wordcount_iteration_2.py`, ...). This is a git repository, so please use the
benefits of git. :wink:

Fork this repository and have fun!
